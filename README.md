## Installation

### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)

In Claude Code, register the marketplace first:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ndemeshchenko/superpowers-marketplace
```

Then install the plugin from this marketplace:

```bash
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

### Verify Installation

Check that commands appear:

```bash
/help
```

```
# Should see:
# /superpowers:brainstorm - Interactive design refinement
# /superpowers:write-plan - Create implementation plan
# /superpowers:execute-plan - Execute plan in batches
```

### Codex (Experimental)

**Note:** Codex support is experimental and may require refinement based on user feedback.

Tell Codex to fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndemeshchenko/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md and follow the instructions.

## Quick Start

### Using Slash Commands

**Brainstorm a design:**
```
/superpowers:brainstorm
```

**Create an implementation plan:**
```
/superpowers:write-plan
```

**Execute the plan:**
```
/superpowers:execute-plan
```

### Automatic Skill Activation

Skills activate automatically when relevant. For example:
- `test-driven-development` activates when implementing features
- `systematic-debugging` activates when debugging issues
- `verification-before-completion` activates before claiming work is done

## What's Inside

### Skills Library

All skills live in `skills/` directory in a flat namespace (e.g., `skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`).

**Testing Skills**
- **test-driven-development** - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- **condition-based-waiting** - Async test patterns
- **testing-anti-patterns** - Common pitfalls to avoid

**Debugging Skills**
- **systematic-debugging** - 4-phase root cause process
- **root-cause-tracing** - Find the real problem
- **verification-before-completion** - Ensure it's actually fixed
- **defense-in-depth** - Multiple validation layers

**Collaboration Skills**
- **brainstorming** - Socratic design refinement (uses zen MCP chat with GPT-5)
- **writing-plans** - Detailed implementation plans
- **executing-plans** - Batch execution with checkpoints
- **dispatching-parallel-agents** - Concurrent subagent workflows
- **requesting-code-review** - Pre-review checklist (uses zen MCP codereview with GPT-5)
- **receiving-code-review** - Responding to feedback
- **using-git-worktrees** - Parallel development branches
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Merge/PR decision workflow
- **subagent-driven-development** - Fast iteration with quality gates

**Meta Skills**
- **writing-skills** - Create new skills following best practices
- **sharing-skills** - Contribute skills back via branch and PR
- **testing-skills-with-subagents** - Validate skill quality
- **using-superpowers** - Introduction to the skills system

### Commands

All commands are thin wrappers that activate the corresponding skill:

- **brainstorm.md** - Activates the `brainstorming` skill
- **write-plan.md** - Activates the `writing-plans` skill
- **execute-plan.md** - Activates the `executing-plans` skill

## How It Works

1. **SessionStart Hook** - Loads the `using-superpowers` skill at session start
2. **Skills System** - Uses Claude Code's first-party skills system
3. **Automatic Discovery** - Claude finds and uses relevant skills for your task
4. **Mandatory Workflows** - When a skill exists for your task, using it becomes required

## Zen MCP Integration

Select skills are enhanced with [zen MCP tools](https://github.com/zenbase-ai/mcp-server-zen) for systematic analysis and expert validation:

**Currently Integrated:**
- **brainstorming** - Uses `mcp__zen__chat` with GPT-5 for collaborative design exploration
- **requesting-code-review** - Uses `mcp__zen__codereview` with GPT-5 for structured code review

**Benefits:**
- Expert model validation of findings
- Structured output with severity levels and confidence scores
- Web search integration for best practices
- Multi-turn conversations with context preservation
- Systematic investigation workflows

**Planned Migrations:**
See `ZEN-MCP-MIGRATION.md` for detailed analysis of upcoming skill enhancements including systematic-debugging, root-cause-tracing, and writing-plans.

## Philosophy

- **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, always
- **Systematic over ad-hoc** - Process over guessing
- **Complexity reduction** - Simplicity as primary goal
- **Evidence over claims** - Verify before declaring success
- **Domain over implementation** - Work at problem level, not solution level

## Contributing

Skills live directly in this repository. To contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your skill
3. Follow the `writing-skills` skill for creating new skills
4. Use the `testing-skills-with-subagents` skill to validate quality
5. Submit a PR
